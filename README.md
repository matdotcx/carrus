git clone https://github.com/matdotcx/carrus.git
cd carrus

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a manifest (firefox.yaml):
```yaml
name: Firefox
version: "123.0"
type: "firefox"
url: "https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/123.0/mac/en-US/Firefox%20123.0.dmg"
filename: "Firefox-123.0.dmg"
code_sign:
  team_id: "43AQ936H96"
  require_notarized: true
build:
  type: "app_dmg"
  destination: "/Applications"
```

2. Download and verify:
```bash
carrus download firefox.yaml
```

3. Build for MDM:
```bash
carrus build-mdm firefox.yaml
```

4. Configure notifications:
```bash
carrus notifications configure --method slack --slack-webhook https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ --slack-channel "#software-updates"
```
